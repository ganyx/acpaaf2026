You are invited to join ACPAAF2026 (9-11 February 2026, Sydney), a forum to share the latest developments and practical applications of particle-based approaches in various fields of science and engineering. Particle-based methods are becoming increasingly popular for studying fluid dynamics, showing a great promise in accurately simulating and measuring fluid flow in a wide range of applications, from microfluidics to macroscopic systems. 


### Topics

- Numerical methods (such as LBM, SPH, and DEM etc.)
- Experimental approaches for studying fluid flow / fluid-particle systems
- Applications using particle-based methods

### Invited Speakers
- Prof Timm Kr√ºger, University of Edinburgh
- Prof Emilie Sauret, Queensland University of Technology (QUT)
- Prof Ha H. Bui, Monash University
- A/Prof Jing Lu, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen
- Dr Morgen Li, The University of Sydney
- Dr Zhongzheng Wang, QUT

### When and Where
